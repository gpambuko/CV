Crossbreeding between local and exotic breeds is known as one strategy to improve animal productivity. Crossing would change allele frequency of gene(s) in a population that isresponsible to phenotype such as growth. This study aims to identify allele frequency changes of Growth Hormone (GH) gene and its association to body measurements in a Boer goat crossbreed population. A total of 44 DNA samples were collected from Boer and its crosses (Boer x Jawa Randu) namely Boerja F1, F2, and F3. To determine GH alleles type, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR - RFLP) using _HaeIII_ enzyme was employed. The body measurements were taken in the form of heart girth (HG), body length (BL) and withers height (WH). This study discovered two alleles, A and B, as well as two genotypes, AA and AB. The frequencies of A allele in Boerja F1, F2 and F3 were 0.50, 0.57, and 0.59 respectively, while the frequencies of B allele were 0.50, 0.43, and 0.41, respectively. Theheterozygosity value was observed to be lower in the respective breeds, and the size of HG differs (p<0.05) between breeds. According to the study, the change in GH gene allele frequency is associated to the body size of resulting Boer crossbreed.
